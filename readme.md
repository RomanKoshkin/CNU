## For kinetics and species concentration see code and Species.pdf

To run the model you will need `super_batch.sh`, `bt_serial.sh` and `Ca_buffer_GHK.py'
* make sure that all these files are in a directory named `STEPS` and that this directory contains a subdirectory `dump`.
* run `super_batch.sh`.
* if you need to change VDCC numbers to simulate, go to `super_batch.sh` and change the relevant values
* in `bt_serial.sh` you can set other simulation parameters (e.g. number of jobs etc.)
